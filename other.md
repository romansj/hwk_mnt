## abc

Liquibase will run DB initialization script, then sample data creation script.
[db.changelog-master.xml](/src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml)
Generated in tool window "JPA Structure" --> Liquibase --> New Liquibase Init Changelog

Sample data by hand and created .sql referenced in master changelog file after init script.

- MapStruct will generate MapStructMapperImpl.java
  Did not use ModelMapper because it doesn't work with Records (https://github.com/modelmapper/modelmapper/issues/546), but MapStruct does https://www.beyondjava.net/mapstruct

JPA notes:

- Specifying GenerationType.SEQUENCE means all sequences are created but none are assigned to ID fields...
- Specifying GenerationType.IDENTITY means one table gets autocincrement like `BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL`, but the rest only get a plain `BIG INT NOT NULL` column

## Comments about the homework (review/opinion of the task)

could write in the beginning. (20231101 despite pains of SPB setup, I am liking this hwk)

Fun to create
Requirements are clear
I hope that I've created it as wanted

For some reason Liquibase generated SQL does not connect the created sequences to the ID fields, so that had to be done manually.
